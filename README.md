# Riddikulus
The following project establishes a simple router with a static routing table which handles Ethernet frames, ARP packets, IPv4 packets, and ICMP packets. It is capable of forwarding as well as creating new frames, the client is able to properly ping all servers with the proper TTLs, and only the correct ARP requests are responded to. The project uses a combination of mininet and vagrant in order to test the connection between the router and client.

All implementations were to be written in Python BSD sockets with no high-level network-layer abstractions. No multi-threading or parallelism was to be used.
